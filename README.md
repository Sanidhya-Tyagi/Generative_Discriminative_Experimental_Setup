The analysis report can be found in the pdf file {Generative_and_Discriminative_Classification_Models.pdf}.  

This repository also contains the jupyter notebook(Experimental_Setup_Generative_and_Discriminative_Classification_Models.ipynb) file for the experimental setup described in the analysis report.  

All the required modules are given in the notebook under a command line function which will automatically run if the first code cell is replicated.
